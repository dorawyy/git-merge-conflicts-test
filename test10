This is file test10 for testcase 10
## Scenario abstraction 
* developer1 worked on two branches (`Feature1 branch` and `master branch` of the repo) (`Feature1 branch` was derived from `master branch`):
* developer1 cloned the remote repo, and fetched the two remote-tracking branch locally:
     * --> `master` branch
     * --> `Feature1` branch
* on `master` branch, deleted `test10` file, add, commit;
* on `Feature1` branch, edited `test10` file, add, commit;
* checkout `master` branch, merge `Feature1` branch; 
* what would happen about merging?
* (after local testing, `push` all changes back to remote repo)
