====== test case 20: Different branches inside one repo, only Alice commits ==== 

## Scenario abstract
* `PR2 branch` _(Pull-Request-2 branch)_ was derived from `PR1 branch` _(Pull-Request-1 branch)_ 
* Alice and Bob worked on the same repo, Alice(`PR2 branch`), Bob(`PR1 branch`)
* Alice made 2 commits on `PR2 branch` locally
* Alice `git push origin PR2`
* Bob made no change on PR1
* Alice made a pull request to Bob:  **FROM**: repo1, PR2 --> **TO**: repo1, PR1
* What would Bob do and meet?
    * if he rebase, then merge the 2 commits?
