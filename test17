This is test file test17, for test case 17

## Scenario abstract
* developer1 worked on two branches (`Feature2` and `Feature3`), `Feature3` was derived from `Feature2`;
* after `Feature3` branch was created,
    * `Feature3` made several commit ( for example, all edit lineX of fileY)
    * `Feature2` edit line X of fileY, 1 commit
* now developer1 would like to merge `Feature3` back to `Feature2`
* however the developer would like to rebase `Feature3` branch -- `git rebase Feature2`
* What would happen?

[Feature2 branch, edit 2] --> line12, edit 2  && [Feature3 branch, edit1] --> line 12 && [Feature3 branch, edit2] --> line 12, this is edit2
