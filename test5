This is test5 file, for testing issue#5:
* developer1 worked on two branches (`Feature1 branch` and `Master branch` of the repo) 
  (`Feature1 branch` was derived from `Master branch`):
* developer1 cloned the remote repo, and fetched the two remote-tracking branch locally:
     * --> `Master` branch
     * --> `Feature1` branch
* on `Feature1` branch, edited `test5` file, add, commit;
* on `Master` branch, no change, no commit;
* checkout `Master` branch, merge `Feature1` branch; 
* what would happen about merging?

--> this is edit from Feature1 branch
