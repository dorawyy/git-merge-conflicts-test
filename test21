### **Exploration question:** 
_What would happen if adding more commits after the pull request is made?_
* Intro: `PR1` works as `base branch`, while `PR2` works as `head branch`
* Alice worked on `PR2` branch, Bob worked on `PR1` branch
* Alice made 1 commit on `PR2`, pushed
* Alice opened a pull request `PR2 --> PR1`
* Alice made more commits on `PR2`, pushed
* what would happen inside the pull request?






[Alice, PR2, commit1, line15]
[Alice, PR2, commit2, line16]
