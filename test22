## Scenario abstract
**--> Different branches inside one repo, both Alice and Bob commit** 
* `PR2 branch` _(Pull-Request-2 branch)_ was derived from `PR1 branch` _(Pull-Request-1 branch)_ 
* Alice and Bob worked on the same repo, Alice(`PR2 branch`), Bob(`PR1 branch`)
* Alice made commits on `PR2 branch` locally
* Alice `git push origin PR2`
* Bob made commits on `PR1 branch` locally
* Bob `git push origin PR1`
* Alice made a pull request to Bob:  **FROM**: repo1, PR2 --> **TO**: repo1, PR1
* What would Bob do and meet?
    * What if he merge directly
    * What if he squash commits then merge?
    * What if he rebase then merge?
