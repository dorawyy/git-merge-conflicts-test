This is test file test16, for test case 16

## Scenario abstract
* developer1 worked on two branches (`Feature2` and `Feature3`), `Feature3` was derived from `Feature2`;
* after `Feature3` branch was created,
    * `Feature3` edited line x of file `test16`, commit
    * `Feature2` edited line x of file `test16`, commit
* now developer1 would like to merge `Feature3` back to `Feature2`
* however the developer would like to rebase `Feature3` branch -- `git rebase Feature2`
* What would happen?
